# RPS_Multiplayer
Rock paper scissors online multiplayer game

Instructions:
To start a game, have one person enter a game key and then click 'Create Game'.  Then have the second player enter that game key and click 'Join Game'.  The game board will then appear for both players and each player can choose their moves and wait for their opponent to choose a move as well.  There is also a chat box on the right side of the page for the players to communicate with.  Each time a winner is chosen, the players can choose a move again and wait for the opponent to choose their move.  It is an endless game until one player leaves the field;


# Issues
- The 'delete game' button doesn't work yet.  I have not written the code to delete the game from the database
- When a player leaves a game, there is no way for him/her to get back to the game as it will say there are already two players in that game.
